    <h1>Closures</h1>
    <span>What Is Closure?</span>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A Closure is an inner function that has access to the outer functions's
        variables in addition to its own variables and global variables.
      </li>
      <li>
        The inner function has access not only to the outer function's variables
        but also to the outer function's parameters.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can create a Closure by adding a function inside another function.
      </li>
      <li>
        Closures are frequently used in JavaScript for object data privacy, in
        event handlers, callback functions, in partial applications, currying
        and other functional programming patterns.
      </li>
      <li>
        A Closure is the combination of a function, bundled together (enclosed)
        with reference to its surrounding state(the lexical environment).
      </li>
      <li>
        A Closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner
        function.
      </li>
      <li>
        In JavaScript Closures are created everytime a function is created, at
        function creation time.
      </li>
      <li>
        To use a Closure, define a function inside another function and expose
        it. To expose a function, return it or pass it to another function.
      </li>
      <li>
        The inner function will have access to the variablesin the outer
        function scope, even after the outer function has returned.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <span>Uses Of Closure</span>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In JavaScript, Closures are the privacy mechanism used to enable data
        privacy.
      </li>
      <li>
        When you used Closure for data privacy, the enclosed variables are only
        in scope within the containing (outer)function. You can't get all the
        data from an outside scope except through the object's
        <strong>Privileged Methods</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        In JavaScript any exposed method defined within the Closure scope is
        privileged.
      </li>
